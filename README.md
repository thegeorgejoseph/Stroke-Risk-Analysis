# Stroke Risk Analysis
 Stroke Risk Analysis on Indian Dataset with Personalised GUI



A research project on Stroke Risk Analysis on Indian Dataset with a Personal GUI aid system as a part of the Final Year Thesis Project in SRMIST. 


Health has always been a spectrum in life that is data rich but analysis poor. This is because people tend to only respect the decision of a medical personal. This project stems from the idea that prevention is better than cure. We propose to model a system which will analyze the lifestyle of civilians in a rural and urban neighborhood and predict the effect of hypertension, heart disease and smoking on the probability of a stroke occurring. Classification is done among the different age groups and Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks will be modelled and compared with the training set to find an algorithm that will predict stroke in civilians with the highest accuracy possible. The model will then be used to test on the testing dataset to predict the probability of a civilian getting a stroke. We then devise a web based application that will provide the user with nutritious food that can help them reduce the risk of stroke. For cases with the probability of stroke being too high, we give information about the cardiac doctors near their location.
